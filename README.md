- 👋 Hi, I’m @tulioamb
- 👀 I’m interested in app developments, mostly related to home automation. This is a hobby and I consider making a job out of it. Also, I'm studying Python, SQL and Data Science! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript to develop an app to control lamps and other stuff around my house.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, SQL...
